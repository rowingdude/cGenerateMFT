# cGenerateMFT

### Version 1.0.0 (2024-08-13)

This project aims to create a C representation of the Python application [GenerateMFT](https://github.com/rowingdude/GenerateMFT/). 
I'm aiming to keep this as basic as possible so it should compile everywhere. If there's an issue compiling on a system I haven't tested, please open an issue.

Current testbase:

1. FreeBSD 14.1 (CC/CLANG)
2. Ubuntu 24.04 (GCC)
3. Windows 11 (CMAKE)

I'm also looking for someone who is better with C than me to give me pointers (lol) on where I can improve.
